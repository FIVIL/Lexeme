## Description

In computer science, lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer, or scanner, though scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. A lexer is generally combined with a parser, which together analyze the syntax of programming languages, web pages, and so forth. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis))


## This Project

This projects mimics the work of a compiler lexical analyser which accepts a sets of defined rules as regular expressions and then by building corresponding NFA's it can analyze and tokenize the given code for any new programming language.

## Clone

You can simply clone this repo and run the code, using Visual Studio 2017+
